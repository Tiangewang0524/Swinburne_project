Of course there are people who choose to work in that industry and that is one thing, however the vast majority of sex 'workers' (for many it's not even work, it's slavery) globally have not made that choice. At some point in their lives someone else has made that choice for them, and taken away their basic human rights.\n.\nWe've got to keep fighting for gender equality and moving into a world where women are in no way seen as the possessions of men. We've come a long way. We still have a long way to go.\n.\nI'm a proud #feminist, also a believer in the beauty of feminine and masculine energy and the differences and compliments that we can bring to each other as different genders, but women are not lesser than men and do not deserve to ever be treated as though they can be taken or used for whatever a man wants.\n.\nGrateful today for the beautiful, powerful and strong men in my life who would never treat a woman this way.

But I should not need to feel lucky to have only had seemingly trivial experiences of sexual harassment. I should not need to feel grateful to have not been raped. The fact that people have endured horrors far worse than I could ever imagine doesn't mean that my experiences are invalid. Almost every woman has experienced sexual harassment in some form and it's clear society needs to change. We should not need to consider the streets we walk down, nor should we feel the need to carry a key between our knuckles. We should not feel that we need to succumb to a man's advances in fear that he will take what he wants anyway. When we hear the term rapist, the person that comes to mind is a stranger in a dark ally. The fact is, this makes a minuscule number (under 4%) of rape cases. Which means that the rest are known to the victim.

My story.\nAs an innocent 5 year old I had something taken from me. What I didn't realize then was that it would change the rest of my life. I was tainted, I was living with the weight of the world on my shoulders. I felt that no one understood me or saw the world through my eyes. My worth got tied up in my appearance and I formed a very unhealthy love for myself. I got through my childhood and teens living with unresolved anger, then in my early 20s at the peak of my unhealthy obsession with my appearance my world, my safety net that I had been living in started to fall apart, my body and the things I loved about it was being taken away by an illness (probably caused by my bottled up anger), I was left \"ugly\" in my eyes. After much soul searching and forgiving myself and the man that put me down this path. I started to realize that my physical appearance was only skin deep and it didn't define who I was, I had to go deep and I had to learn to love all parts of me the good and the bad. This would be my healing. I'm not perfect and I still have a long way to go. But I just want you all to know the seriousness of sexual abuse and/or assault, it changed my life and for many years I thought it had ruined it, but I'm back and I'm stronger than ever.

I have seen men and women stand up for me, at direct odds with their own job security and personal security.\n\nI have been told by a (woman) HR director to never mention why I quit, and threaten me that if I did, I would never work in music again.\n\nAnd I have seen others hurt. I have seen everything from bullying and body shaming from senior men to junior women, all the way through to physical intimidation and unwanted advances.\n\nAs a journalist I have had grown men stalk me, find out personal information about me, troll me and comment inappropriately in order to demean me because in their eyes I shouldn't have a voice.\n\nI have even experienced inappropriate physical advances from a senior woman, because I guess the abuse of power - although generally from men - also can come from women.\n\nI have had dozens of experiences, and once when I pitched an article about this very topic, wanting to somehow validate my experiences or make sense of them, I was told by a (woman) editor that none of them were \"serious\" enough to warrant writing a whole article about it.\n\nAnd, now, that same editor posted \"me too\".

Some of us have crossed harder lines but sexism and misogyny is ingrained in our everyday lives and you don't have to be a rapist to perpetuate rape culture. Just cos you're gay also doesn't make you inherently a feminist or incapable of disrespecting women. You don't get a free pass to touch without consent or call her a bitch or slut. Misogyny also hurts gay men too cos it's at the root of homophobia. Awareness of our behaviour tho can bring fresh perspective, understanding and realisation that what we do dictates female lives. It might be scary to confront but we can do it. Here's a couple of things I know we can commit to doing:\n. - listen - dont blame the victim or trivialise sexual assault. Trust and believe them - no more misogynistic/sexually aggressive jokes - do not idealise and normalise hyper-masculinity\n- stop saying vaginas are gross. The ppl that say this are the same ones that get their ass ate so like wyd? - speak up when our friends/colleagues behave inappropriately but also check ourselves - don't say 'what if that was your daughter, sister, mother' to make it relatable cos the value of women does not lie in relation to any man\n- talk about consent as an ongoing process that can be retracted at any point espesh if you're in an intimate relationship\n- recognise you don't have a strong black women inside you - call out sexist media but also check the entitlement we feel over critiquing female pop stars and women in media - don't send unsolicited dick pics\n.\n\nListening to the voices of women (of colour), femme gays, trans and non-binary people is crucial to ALL men.

The day that this happened we went to the doctor and he told me to stop crying and I did and went and got an X-ray we had to go home and wait 3 hours for the report in that time he thought it would be appropriate to have sex this like a lot of women say it\u2019s not rape when u are in a relationship but it is and was that day I was in pain and he didn\u2019t care he had but me in this position as well. I left like most of us do or like a lot of women here in Australia are getting killed. So I am lucky I have my life still. It\u2019s very hard for me to trust men now but maybe one day.

This photo was taken on the 20th of September 2014. This photo was taken at a uni ball. This photo was taken when I was happy and completely unaware of what was to come later that night. On the 20th of September 2014 I was drugged and sexually assulted and it changed me forever. I didn't want to deal with what happened to me. I was embarrassed, felt violated, was scared of all men, scared to tell my loved ones in fear of it affecting them and making them feel my pain. For years I didn't deal. I broke. I became depressed and had lots of panic and anxiety attacks. That was until last year I made the decision not to let this coward win. Not to let this horrible man destroy me. I started talking about it to my friends and this year started telling my family (some of which I still haven't told). It broke their hearts just as much as it broke mine to tell them and talk about it again. I am healing everyday. I am strong. I am not alone. I am no longer embarrassed or assamed. I no longer let this man ruin me. I have begun to let people into my life again and are bringing down my walls with time and trust. Ladies (or men) if anyone has ever hurt you in any way you are not alone. Be stronger than them. Fight for you not for anyone else. You can get through this and there are many different ways to begin your healing. I never used to be able to look at this photo as it would bring back the memories of a night I never want to remember. But now I look at this photo and see a girl who was lost and completely unaware of how cruel the world can be.. and it reminds me of how much I have grown as a person. My growth, strength and determination to keep on going. And now I am happier than ever. I want to help others who have been in a similar position. So please don't be afraid to reach out to me. Dont let these horrible people win. Be better than them. We are stronger than them \ud83d\udcaa#metoo #healing #stoptheviolence #strength #happy #bebrave", "attitude": "negative"},

Even though I talk about women all the time, this isn\u2019t easy.\n\nI was 9 years old. A 9 year old doesn\u2019t know... whats happening. All I knew was I didn\u2019t like it. I\u2019d stay up all night eating desserts bcos I was scared of falling asleep. To this date, I hate sweets. They make me sick in my stomach. While it\u2019s irrelevant to discuss who the man was, let\u2019s just say, it definitely wasnt a stranger. He was my role model. They say perpetrators roam the streets of the night but they\u2019re also a part of the very safe zone that exists to protect us... Family.\n\nFrom age of 9 to 20, I thought it was my fault. Or that I imagined it. No one talked about it. Turns out a psychologist told my mom to act like it never happened - \u2018She\u2019s too young. She will forget\u2019 he said... So the one day at the age of 9 when I saw her crying was the first & last time it was spoken of.\nI didn\u2019t forget.\n\n5 years ago we talked. There were tears & confrontations. It wasn\u2019t easy. But it\u2019s what bought my family closer. My mother & my brother have been my strongest pillars in this journey & the people that are close to me - know the truth. It isn\u2019t something I feel the need to hide from those I love, but up until today - I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d talk about it publicly.\n\nLast few years I\u2019ve been trying to motivate women in my country to speak. I regret not having talked most of my childhood. I wish I\u2019d asked my mom sooner, \u2018why dont we ever talk about what happened?\u2019 Instead of blaming myself everyday.\n\nI know its hard to accept sexual abuse but the support of my family & friends gave me strength. It\u2019s your choice who you wish to speak to, but please do speak. Tell someone that can make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThe magnitude of the problem is bigger than we address it to be. I don\u2019t know a single girl that hasn\u2019t been harassed at some point in her life & that to me has become so... normal. It shouldn\u2019t be. Our silence is part of the problem. \nBeing a victim of rape/harassment isnt something to be ashamed of.

We need to talk and encourage others to speak up to know we are not alone.

I commend the bravery of these women as I know how hard it is to tell these stories but it also gives other women the power to do the same. I know what it's like to have people turn their backs, but I also know the love and support of both men and women who know this behaviour is abhorrently wrong! It's hard to speak up about something so embarrassing but it's an abuse of Power and you should never blame yourself no matter how much you think it's your fault. It's a tough process but stand up to them.  Smart intelligent women are often caught up in these situations and fear speaking up in fear of the consequences.. The use of threats, intimidation, paying for silence, Non Disclosure Agreements and turning blind eyes is no longer becoming a power..

Saddened that this type of behaviour seem to be normalised among men and even institutionalised in some industries. Hopeful by the courage demonstrated by all women daring to share their stories, and the powerful movement created when we come together to demand change.\n\nAs most women around me I have also experienced this, so many times that I have changed my own behaviour. For example, I never sit on the inner seat on busses, trains, airplanes or anywhere. This since I've too many times found myself next to a man that seems to think it is ok to touch my leg, and even feel up my butt as I walk past him. In these situations I've often tried to ignored my instincts, telling myself that I'm imagining things, \"he might mistaken my leg for the seat\" and so on... I am horrified that that society have women in these situations doubting themselves and excusing men for their inappropriate and even illegal behaviour.

And I do include myself here, I just find it harder to advocate for me alone. So my mind's been scanning through all the women I know and love who are in my life or no longer there for various reasons. Mostly those I went through treatment with, who could barely tell their stories if they tried \u2014 because the things that happened shattered minds, because memories weren't stored as narrative, because we were too young, because touching on things triggers such overwhelm there is muteness, or emotion so great it can initially only be dealt with via extreme measures. Lots of reasons. After months and in some cases years in clinic together, we never knew each other's details. It wasn't necessary and it wasn't safe, even in a closed environment moderated by specialised trauma counsellors.\nMy worry extends to women outside this hospital system who haven't processed assaults as stories, either, but carry them daily as heavy wells of shame, rage and deep fear. I'm thinking of all of you; you didn't choose to have all this in your face, when you are trying to get by. You could use the word 'assault' to describe the volume of graphic detail, in every media stream. You could also say 'ableist'.\n-\nThere's been hypocrisy, as others have pointed out. Self-congratulatory posts by men who do not know how complicit they've been. But also reels of content from women who have gone on to become bullies at best, emotionally abusive at worst, whose behaviour's become normalised and is basically written into T&Cs of forums. Ostracising, shunning, pile ons. Verbal abuse. Wrongful accusations of abuse toward those who healthily question or are critical. And people encourage this, or turn away, or appease perpetrators to secure their own safety. Does sexual abuse excuse psychological abuse? I am at my word limit. I have clearly got shit going on, and that's kinda the point.", "attitude": "negative"},

This guy was a popular athlete and a sports captain - somebody who had been entrusted by his fellow peers with a position of power. He approached me at a party and cornered and assaulted me. For him, it was likely nothing. For me, it's been a constant daily memory, burned into my existence, my consciousness, for over a decade. For 12 long years I have lived in shame, fear, and disgust. The all-encompassing self-hatred, the anger, the powerlessness, the chronic depression, the multiple attempts at suicide, the chronic drug and alcohol addiction, the inability to enjoy physical intimacy with partners, and the crushing anxiety and helplessness that I have had to live with and adapt to has irreparably shaped who I am as a person today. The worst thing about it? I doubt this piece of shit even remembers. For 12 years, the only people who were aware of this were him and me. That changes today. It has taken me this long to even feel comfortable just talking about it. So I wonder, if all this bullshit can stem from one guy grabbing another guys crotch, then what's it like for females? and for victims of sustained sexual abuse? I shudder to even think how fucked up people would feel inside after something like that happens to them. So I say to you, as a man, and as a victim, that this shit needs to be DEALT WITH. NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE YOU FEEL THIS WAY. I stand with those who have suffered, regardless of gender, race or creed. I'm here for you, even if you don't know it.

In the midst of the #HarveyWeinstein abuse that has come out, I think a lot of men have been quick to condemn these acts of sexual violence, but are reticent to accept how they themselves contribute to the larger issue. You don't have to be a rapist to be a part of the problem - it is the 'jokes' and 'locker room talk', the catcalling and 'compliments', the everyday instances of male privilege that perpetuate rape culture.\n\nWomen shouldn't have to experience retraumatisation for men to understand the magnitude of this problem, but at the same time I do feel that a sense of solidarity comes about in joining other women who have come forward, allowing a platform for the tales that we may have tried to forget.\n\nMen who might be reading this, if the #notallmen argument enters your mind while reading this, PLEASE do us all a favour and educate yourself - I'd suggest starting with the everydayfeminism.com article on 'examples of male privilege in all areas of life'.

You can't go back to who you were before, but there is strength built from the ashes of domestic abuse, which I've experienced in two relationships now. Luckily, I've had an overwhelming amount of support. Lately, there's been many conversations had online. Women have shared their stories with me both in person & online. I literally have cried & felt such emotional depth the past 24hrs that I posted my \"emotional wreck\" of a self this morning because this issue is so much bigger than I already thought I had my head around. Definitely don't want this post to be a downer, just wanted to share something REAL with you peeps. My life is far from picture perfect & sometimes it feels like a lie when we only display our best selves to the world. \nIt's ok to cry, feel pain & have experienced trauma. This is life. Unfortunately there's great ups & terrible downs, but hopefully you can learn from it & maybe even help someone who is in the same boat one day. Dont be afraid to share your story.

She is right in saying that we cannot let this conversation be swapped away by fast media. \nGrowing up I was always pretty sheltered. I was taught to be wary and careful when in public, but I never let that get in the way of daily life. \nI remember taking the ferry across to the island in my hometown one day, wearing shorts and a sleeveless top. My best friend picked me on the other side and advised me to wear more \u201cmodest clothing\u201d whilst on public transport. Before either of us could drive, she would travel by bus with a change of clothes at hand because what she would wear on a daily basis was not deemed appropriate for the bus. I never realise the stares I would get by random men and subconsciously I started wearing more \u201cmodest clothing\u201d when I knew I had to take the ferry. \nThe start of this year my cousins and I were at New Years countdown. I was wearing a sleeveless top with baggy long pants. We were walking through a crowd of people when this guy grabbed my ass from behind. He walked away before I had time to process what had happened. I was stunned and didn\u2019t know what to do. Part of me wanted to run after him and call him out but the other part of me was scared that if I did, I may provoke him and something worse than an ass grab would happen. \nI remember standing in the shower that night just scrubbing myself because I felt so violated. I felt disgusted that someone thought they had ownership over my body. I kept thinking, what could I have done to prevent that? I wanted to ask him why the fuck did he think he had the right to do that? [continue reading below]", "attitude": "negative"},

I'd like to clarify that this movement was not something to take opportunistically as a self gratifying rant for injustice. Instead it was a step forward towards creating awareness that such crimes occur so often and as a society how we have almost redefined it as 'normal' acceptable behaviour. By acceptable I mean that it's strangely seen as excusable & in most instances, ignored and left unpunished.\n\nThe reason I wish to follow up on this movement is because while the #metoo movement was a great way to gain insight into the proportion of unjust sexual assaults that go unoticed... it has also\u00a0alerted perpetrators of the proportion of them that get away with it. This can have 1 of 2 effects 1) deterance to furthur engage in such acts out of fear of being called out on it or 2) the assumption that if so many people are doing it, and getting away with it, is there really anything wrong? \nWhich brings me to the point that as a society we are now 100% liable for the outcome of how this movement turns out. We are now well aware & educated that such things happen all the time, everywhere, all around us. So my question to you now is what are you going to do about it?\n\nAre you just going to stand around and watch or are you going to do something? If you suspect something strange is going on with a friend in her relationship, or a coworker, or your child at school/home are you going to ask the right questions and offer help or PRETEND and ignore because that's easier than actually dealing with the problem?? Abuse/assault changes the lives of victims. The darkness is very real & often long lasting. The self doubt, fear, insomnia, lack of trust, shame, guilt, paranoia, loss of faith, struggle to believe in goodness & the choice to rise above takes courage & sometimes having the right support can make all the difference.\n\nIt is the action that WE CHOSE TO TAKE FROM HERE ON that will determine the outcome of this movement. Awareness from #metoo is step one, let ACTION be our step two #dosomething \u2764", "attitude": "negative"},

I had posted this photo on social media and afterwards was scrutinised for my very existence and called every derogatory name possible from a so-called \u2018boyfriend\u2019 at the time. Furthermore, when I decided to retaliate and stand my ground, I was dragged by the hair, thrown to the ground and my ribs fractured. Crying would make things worse as it risked making too much noise that could possibly alarm neighbours, so I was told I had 10 seconds to stop before I\u2019d be put to sleep - with his hands over my face and around my neck cutting off oxygen supply. The abusive patterns and behaviours used to manipulate, coerce fear and form ongoing control in a relationship can be one of the hardest battles to recognise and overcome when it is carried out by someone close. It was from the support of close friends that enabled me to break the cycle and re-establish that sense of freedom and essence of life/happiness again. \nI\u2019ve shared this brief personal encounter in the hope that it brings to light how prevalent violence against women in Australia can be, not to mention worldwide.

The lows, the very lows, the deceit, the manipulation and the downright horror; I could write a novel with none of it very flattering. What it did open my eyes to though and in a positive fashion if there can be one was the frightening levels at which violence within our homes is prevalent in the community across all socio-economic backgrounds, from the wealthiest to the poorest amongst us. 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men are said to have been victims of partner-related violence with up to 95% of that going unreported. My experience was ultimately positive because I try find the positive in everything but more so because I learned so much on something I\u2019d been so naive about; so much about the disgustingly high rate of (mostly) women and their children in refuge or waiting for respite and desperate for support and care. So much about the epic rates in which women at retirement age are left homeless; those typically who have stayed home, not earned income, and who had found their fortunes had changed. Did you know that\u2019s the fastest growing genre for homelessness in our country at the moment? Those women who are typically my Mum\u2019s age who should be enjoying retirement after having worked hard and raised a family? They\u2019re the ones who are forced to find refuge on our city streets at night. I learned so much about who victims of violence and particularly domestic violence are and I assure you everyone of you will know someone affected who more than likely hasn\u2019t had the courage to speak up for fear or retaliation. There\u2019s so much we can do as a society to try to improve these alarming occurrences - even by taking small steps you can make a difference - but one of the most powerful of all things we can do is educate. I\u2019m working hard to have my organisation recognise domestic violence under their personal health and well-being policy; I\u2019m not yet there but I\u2019m trying to implement the change I want to see in the organisation. If there can be a winner in what was a desperately bleak situation I truly believe I was one and I hope I\u2019ll never stop learning from that. \n#australia #bethechange #metoo", "attitude": "negative"},

You are not going to change anything, you have allowed it to happen and it will continue to happen, all You are doing is calling attention to the rebirth of an industry in decay.\n\nI think that third dress is an indictment of the nut job designer who created it. It has NOTHING about it that recommends that the #designer has real talent\n\nNothing says \"I'm a strong proud woman\" like showing your #tits & #ass off in public for the same people & industry who sexually harassed or raped you women.\n\nThese #metoo promoting cheap & plastic puppets are promoting all the wrong morals.\n\nI count my #blessings that both my ex-wives are extremely modest & have the highest of moral character\n\nI wonder if anyone will show up in a white & bespoke simple dress showing some class @hollywoodreporter\n@tmz_tv @variety @hiltonhotels @bevhillshotel", "attitude": "positive"},

Literally three seconds after the network's prize pig Don Burke was exposed as a serial predator, sexual harasser and repeat groper of women - you've decided the best managerial decision you can make right now is to give a platform to a man who doesn't actually sound like a sexist at all but a fully signed up member of the Misogynists Forever fan club.\u2019 @clementine_ford\u2018s full article sums up my thoughts exactly on this ad in today\u2019s article, link in my bio for the next 24 hours \u2b06\ufe0f. She also provides a link to a petition to get men like this off our TV screens.\n\nAnd Dean, whoever you are, I would be taking @anthonymanton\u2018s advice; finding a big rock & hiding under it. For you Mr have just been cast as the villain, to be thrown to the wolves by #9married for all for ratings. \nNine, you are simply vile for providing people spouting misogynistic ideals a platform just to cause controversy \ud83d\ude21. #hangyourheadinshame9 #MeToo #marriedatfirstsight #9married #MAFS \nhttp://bit.ly/NineWhatAreYouThinking", "attitude": "negative"},

We all had enough, so we created the most important hashtag #metoo where millions of us women came together to support each other in breaking the silence about sexual harassment and violence. I am so proud of us who voiced out, although hearing all of our stories breaks my heart. There are so many of us, (victims of sexual assault) , yet we feel so afraid to speak up. As a result of this movement, many powerful men got fired and exiled for abusing their power for sexual gain. So ladies I honestly feel this year is a milestone to a more equal world for us to live in. \nI\u2019m so excited to see what 2018 has to offer.

If you are in a financial position in which you can afford to donate money to the Time's Up Legal Defence Fund this will help women who are brave enough to speak up about their experiences but unfortunately cannot afford legal representation, and donating will also add your name to the Letter of Solidarity. The link to their website can be found via the @timesupnow Instagram- I strongly recommend checking it out, if not for the gofundme link then at least to read the facts and check out some recourses so that you can help other women in need. Not in a position to donate money? That's okay! Wear black today to show support for these women and post your photo with the hashtag #timesup - spreading the word is just as important as donating! Making a post on social media can make a huge difference by encouraging others to donate if they can, as well as tackling the shame and stigma surrounding what is considered a taboo subject.

And I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories... And there's someone else, Recy Taylor, a name I know and I think you should know, too. In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and mother walking home from a church service she'd attended in Abbeville, Alabama, when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped, and left blindfolded by the side of the road coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the NAACP where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice. But justice wasn't an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died ten days ago, just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up.\n\nTheir time is up. And I just hope\u2014I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth, like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented, goes marching on. It was somewhere in Rosa Parks' heart almost 11 years later, when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery, and it's here with every woman who chooses to say, \"Me too.\" And every man\u2014every man who chooses to listen... I've interviewed and portrayed people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights. So I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon!\u201d #divinefeminine #newyear #timesup", "attitude": "positive"},

Currently I\u2019m working as an Uber driver after falling ill 5yrs ago, Uber has been great to get me back into the mindset of working again and also helps my mum out after her business lost some clients. On 9th Dec\u201917, a guy thought that because I was being a \u201cnice person\u201d that, that was it was ok for him to flick off his seatbelt as we pulled up to his address and grab me around the back of the head & neck and pull me in to try & kiss me. I managed to turn my head just enough that he made contact with my cheek, kissing me down my face & neck. I managed to scream & throw my hands up, but he didn\u2019t let me go. He was holding on strong, I couldn\u2019t get out of his grip, he said \u201cI would really love to kiss you right now\u201d I said \u201cI know said I don\u2019t have a boyfriend but I am seeing someone\u201d! He kept pushing & I told him he was being \u201ctotally inappropriate & just get out\u201d! He finally did, not without saying \u201cYour LOSS BABY\u201d! Like I was missing out on such a great guy! He was drunk & high on Cocaine, but that\u2019s no excuse. From what I\u2019ve seen on his social media, him & his friends love to treat women like trophies, making references to #harveyweinstein !

I want to say something: Two of the photographers I have idolized for years (Bruce Weber and Mario Testino), now have been accused of sexual harassment towards male models and assistants over the decades of their careers. When I first heard about it, I really did not want to believe it - but here it is folks. Another industry built on corrupt power structures and abusive tendencies.. and where you are not memorable unless you submit to such sexual advances from men in powerful positions. While we have seen in the media statements from victims who are widely female, this shows that it is not a gendered issue... men wishing to advance in the modelling industry (and other industries alike) are widely being taken advantage of due to the nature of their careers and the negative impact that would ruin their careers in the event that they say \"No\". These photographers are talented. But I know that there is photographers out there with the same potential who would put the safety and comfort of their models first.

It is truly an oasis from the chaotic madness that abounds just an arms throwaway on the Hollywood walk of Fame. It is oddly peaceful and relaxing if you can ignore the one or two arrogant attention seekers talking abrasively loud about a \u201cdeal\u201d coming through, or the squealing bikini clad valley girls who took an uber in to hang with \u201cChad\u201d (yes, actually Chad) by the pool as the sun goes down and the heat from the sun with it. The staff here are appropriately conversational, but more to it, warm. I had worthy conversations with up and coming jazz musicians, a red-haired Emma Stone look-alike busey who spent 4 months interning and waitressing in Prahran and also met travellers from Korea, Hawaii, Alabama, Australia and shared opinions on politics, the #metoo movements, sexual harassment, love, travel, business and dreams. I\u2019m not one for main attractions and having lived in L.A as a working resident, avoided the Hollywood area in general, so it was by location of my traveling companions that I stayed here. The Roosevelt Hotel is more then lodging for Hollywood enthusiasts and weary travellers, it\u2019s like a caring grandfather who waits up for you with the light on, knowing that you will be home sometime between midnight and barely sunrise. And even though he wants to tell you off for going out doing all sorts, he remains silent, reminiscent of the good old days of Marilyn Munroe and Marlon Brando who did it all, he\u2019s just happy your room in your bed. #roosevelt #roosevelthotel #losangeles #california #america #hollywood #glamorous #vintage #stories #travellers #travel #travelblogger #writer #writersofinstagram #onlocation #pool #sunny #sunnydays", "attitude": "positive"},

She gave strong hugs and I do the same. I will make you feel me. For having a sister that has endured times that would make most men crumble and break and yet she still has a soft heart and constantly puts others before her own needs. For having friends of both genders who recognize that if we aren't ALL equal then we are failing as a society and they are willing to march in protest. To the mothers of my kiddos doing it single mom style. For having 3 beautiful nieces who are being raised knowing that can be and do whatever they choose. For having 2 nephews who will know how to love women as their equals and be accountable for their actions rather than being told \"boys will be boys\". No excuses. \nYou're posts today have gotten me fired up. Thank you to everyone back in the US who is fighting the good fight. I love you. \nI splurged on Steak, lobster and whiskey in your honor. #womensmarch #timesup", "attitude": "positive"},

My rig was great, but I wasn\u2019t actually happy. I worked out twice a day, everyday (and felt like absolute shit if i missed a workout) & restricted every aspect my eating (under the guise of #cleaneating) as a means of controlling every detail of my life to hide/avoid facing my crippling PTSD after being raped. At one point, said PTSD was so bad that if i wasn\u2019t going to the gym or work i couldn\u2019t leave my home. At times the depression was so heavy I was suicidal. I thought becoming totally obsessed with sprinting and lifting PB\u2019s would make all of my wounds go away. I was wrong. i still had to face it eventually and also wound up with a nice bout of #orthorexia to deal with as well. You can\u2019t outrun your trauma, trust me i fucking tried. BUT, It\u2019s been 6 years since that trauma became a part of my life. I\u2019m so proud of how I have overcome it and how it has helped shaped me into who I am today. I do sometimes miss being this fit (because shit i looked good and fuck i could lift heavy), but im also completely happy with my softer, curvier body that bends, stretches & supports me through a strong yoga practice, shakes on the dance floor while i stomp, or gently envelopes the people i love when i hold them. I have such love and adoration for my body at any size now, after hating every inch of it for years because i felt like it failed me after that happened. If you\u2019re going through hell because someone stole your power from you, keep going.

He said Garcia was visibly intoxicated.\n\nFierro, who was 25 at the time, did not report the incident because he worried about the long-term consequences that could come with accusing the powerful lawmaker, who chairs the Legislative Women\u2019s Caucus and the Natural Resources Committee. But in January he told his former boss, Democratic Assemblyman Ian Calderon, who referred the matter to an assembly panel that is now investigating Garcia.\n\nPolitico was the first to report on Fierro\u2019s allegations. The story also included sexual misconduct allegations against Garcia from an anonymous male lobbyist that The Post was not able to independently verify.\n\nIn a statement sent to The Post through a spokeswoman, Garcia said she did not recall doing anything wrong. \u201cThe details of these claims have never been brought to my attention until today,\u201d the statement read. \u201cI can confirm that I did attend the 2014 legislative softball game with a number of members and my staff. I can also say I have zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behavior and such behavior is inconsistent with my values.\u201d Garcia has established herself as a champion of women\u2019s rights and an advocate for victims since she was elected to the legislature in 2012.

Often small experiences like this get brushed off as dramatisation of events and that you shouldn\u2019t take things to heart, but language like this doesn\u2019t stop the fact that a man made me feel vulnerable to the extent where I locked my doors and made sure he drove away before I did so he didn\u2019t follow me. I didn\u2019t think anything would happen, but it was still enough to make me question my safety.\n\nI\u2019m a bit sick of being told to stay safe when I don\u2019t put myself into situations where there is potential danger. Others create the danger. And sure you can tell me that I should be more aware of my environment, that I should've got my car keys out before I got to my car etc. but at the same time you are saying that a man yelling 'hey gorgeous' or 'I wish I was going where you are going' at me is just simple flirting, but last I checked someone spontaneously yelling  is anything but pleasant. I was doing a normal thing by walking to my car after my shift. It wasn't a back alley. It wasn't a dark street. Yet, no matter what the situation is, in some way any sort of harassment becomes the victim's fault.\n\nI'm pretty over it. Even justified, academic arguments about this topic are told the same thing: to shut up. Imagine if the #suffragettes had done that.\n\nSo #timesup Australia. #Makeequalityapriority *I do not own the image*", "attitude": "positive"},

We're both suffering from different types of sleep deprivation due to our daughters Mabel - 2, and Sylvie - 18 months. We have very different lives now, Bridget and I. When watching the film last night, filmed June last year, we were one and the same for the most part. Mammas of two kids, similar ages. Exhausted and engergised at the same time; we were on a dream road trip. Fuelled by our big business goals and starry-eyed sweet dreams, we took to the road to create the Rise Documentary. A film about inspiring, everyday women facing the challenges of our modern world, much like we were.\n.\nThe film spoke to the range of 'tugs at the heart' that many women face, and this was explored more deeply with the panel afterwards, as Bridget and I sat with 2 of the women featured in the film: entrepreneur @tina_tower and @endotaspa\u2019s Melanie Gleeson. The passionate discussion that followed between ourselves and the audience recognised that the values we have, the stories we tell ourselves, and our willingness to dream big and develop resilience in the face of immense challenge, all govern our destiny.\nHead to my Facebook page for what we discussed and what we learnt. Link in bio.\n.\nThe main takeaway for us both and for those attending was the more we surround ourselves with stories of women doing things that inspire us,the more we make it possible for ourselves.\n\u2764\ufe0fJess & Bridget \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "attitude": "positive"},

Do we rely too much on social media \u2018spreading the word\u2019 and giving us a platform for free speech yet besides the strength of the @womensmarch @timesupnow and #metoo movements, should we be doing more? Yes, we have better rights for women in some countries than those of the suffragette era, yet we\u2019ve barely touched the surface if you look back to the campaigns and movements in action decades ago. And for all of the rights and privilege some of us have, shouldn\u2019t we be fighting harder for the women who aren\u2019t as fortunate?\n.\nCan we do better? I believe the answer is YES. Always.

I will let them tell you about equality, fairness, opression, abuse, and condescension still facing women the world over. \nPROFESSIONALLY what i can tell you is that my industry is still incredibly male-dominated. I can also tell you that fashion is still coming around to the idea of diversity: whether that is an ethnic thing, or the use of non-straight-sized models on the runway and in campaigns. It is so fantastic to see designers like @csiriano including all kinds of models in his shows. I don't think in australia we are there yet. The overwhelming model body type here is still prepubescent, and i really hope it changes.\nPERSONALLY today I'd like to wish everyone some LOVE and a shot of CONFIDENCE. I desperately struggle with both; it's partly a bipolar thing I'm sure, but mostly it's a soul thing.

These guys have backed the big moves of my career, significant moves. These guys made me feel like I could deliver when I have felt very alone on this non-traditional career path \u2022 Ladies, we are surrounded by extraordinary men whose ongoing support, mentorship & sponsorship creates real and lasting opportunity for us.
